The SPC file format is a file format in which all kinds of spectroscopic
data, including amongst others infrared spectra, Raman spectra and UV/VIS

length and each record stores a different kind of data (instrumental
information, information on one spectrum of a dataset, the spectrum itself
or extra logs).

Examples
--------
>>> from specio import specread
>>> from specio.datasets import load_spc_path
>>> spectra = specread(load_spc_path())
x-y(1)
>>> spectra.wavelength
array([  400.62109375,   402.94384766,   405.26721191, ...,  3797.08911133,
        3798.45288086,  3799.81542969])
>>> spectra.spectrum
array([[ 1487.        ,  1385.        ,  1441.        , ...,
          147.24124146,   139.16082764,   134.08041382]])
